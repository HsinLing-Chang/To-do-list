# To-do-list

Sample solution for the task-tracker challenge from roadmap.sh.

## Introduction

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently by providing features like adding, deleting, updating, and listing tasks.

## Features

- **Add new tasks**: Users can add new tasks to task manager by providing a description. Each task will be assigned a unique ID. The initial status would be set to "todo".
- **Delete tasks**: Users can delete the task from the list by providing the task's unique ID.
- **Update tasks**: The description and status can be update. This requires the task's ID. Users can choose either update the description or status of the task, or they can update both.
- **List tasks**: Users can view all tasks in the list or filter them by status. The statuses available for filtering are "todo", "in-progress" and "done".
